        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.<br> Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as obr
    perators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;<br> for example</p>

        <h1 id="javascript_and_java">JavaScript and Java</h1>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. <br> The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking</p>
    <p>JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,<br> naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript</p>

        <h1 id="Hello_world">Hello world</h1>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
    <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

        <h1 id="variables">Variables</h1>
    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
    <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase)</p>
